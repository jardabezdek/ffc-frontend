### :envelope: Deployment

The following is written in [the official streamlit docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#manage-your-app-in-github):

> Your GitHub repository is the source for the app, so that means that any time you push an update
> to your repo you'll see it reflected in the app in almost real time. Try it out!
>
> Streamlit also smartly detects whether you touched your dependencies, in which case it will
> automatically do a full redeploy for youâ€”which will take a little more time. But since most
> updates don't involve dependency changes, you should usually see your app update in real time.
